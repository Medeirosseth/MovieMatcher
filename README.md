## Description :scroll:

An app that shows a user a page which displays a bunch of movies information (movie poster, title, trailer, and description). The user can say "yes" or "no" to the movies, indicating whether or not they would like to watch said movies. Then another user will be presented with the same list of movies and can indicate whether or not they'd like to watch those movies (presumably with the first user). When matches are found an alert is given. At any time the second user can press a button that will display the list of movies that both users said "yes" to.
