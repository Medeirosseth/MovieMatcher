//Project name/objective (MVP)
// project overview (Seth)
// andChill (Ryan, Giancarlo, Michael)
// This will allow 2 users the chance to each choose which movies they would want to watch or not based on the most popular movies available for streaming. 
// If they have both chosen the same movie they do want to watch, they will get a "Match" (yes, it's Tinder for movies) 
// This will take out all of the guess-work in the debate about what to watch tonight.
//
// demo: (Ryan )
//
// process (Michael)
// started with white boarding MVP and stretch goals 
//( MVP changed over time do to further reading of what our api was able to do)
// spent the beginning of monday all researching apis and discussed potential for each api 
// didn't move forward on ideas without everyone's consent
// initial MVP was to be able to match two users choices based on a movie list
// further exploration of our api we were able to go based of hardcoded movies and used the api to call their movie poster 
// then we had the arrays populated from the API 
// we were then able to add trailers using a second API call 
//
// challenges (Giancarlo)
// keeping eachothers' ideas in check on what was obtainable and what was a stretch goal 
// merging conflicts (shared screen and merged files together to help ease anxiety)
// any challenges a pair ran into we would get we would get the other pair to take a look 
// getting a fresh pair of eyes on the problem was able to solve the problem quickly  
//
// overview
// great teamwork
